Over that period, the company expects to be able to mine 1,280 bitcoins, approximately equal to $11 mln at today&#x2019;s exchange rates.<\/p><p>The developers then plan to sell off the mined coins as well as the mining equipment to provide <a href=\"https://cointelegraph.com/tags/investments\" target=\"_blank\">investment<\/a> returns, says the funding platform for the project, <a href=\"https://envestors.envestry.com/blog/bladetec-decrypting-the-bitcoin-mine-block-by-block?utm_source=Subscribed+database+as+at+8.02.18&amp;utm_campaign=146365b668-EMAIL_CAMPAIGN_2018_03_15&amp;utm_medium=email&amp;utm_term=0_04567c4093-146365b668-437292097&amp;mc_cid=146365b668&amp;mc_eid=819db052bd\" rel=\"nofollow,noopener\" target=\"_blank\">Envestry<\/a>.<\/p><p>Bladetec founder John Kingdon claims that despite the negative difference between the mining farm&#x2019;s setup cost and its expected returns, the investors should still be able to turn a profit, after the sale of the equipment is accounted for.<\/p><p>TBBMC expects investment returns to follow one of four scenarios depending on the value of Bitcoin in the next two years. The scenarios range from a per annum price drop of up 40 percent, to a per annum price increase of over 50 percent.<\/p><p><img alt=\"pic\" src=\"https://cointelegraph.com/storage/uploads/view/5ed55b654b605969f4a7ae34f98e3459.png\" title=\"pic\"><\/p><p dir=\"ltr\">Founded in 2002, Bladetec has provided IT support, supplying, and consulting services to such bodies as the UK Ministry of Defence, NATO, and The National Grid. According to Evenstry, TBBMC will be the first Bitcoin mine in Europe funded by investors in a limited company protected by UK law.<\/p><p>According to the project, the TBBMC facility will cover 3,500 square feet at three locations in London, Surrey, and Suffolk. Considering the high price of mining one bitcoin in the UK, which <a href=\"https://cointelegraph.com/news/mining-margins-and-where-to-make-the-most-money\" target=\"_blank\">reportedly<\/a> amounts to about $8,400, most of the raised funds would be spent on energy costs, as the company is planning to mine 1,280 bitcoins, writes The Telegraph.<\/p> <div id=\"quiz\"> <\/div>",

  "body": "<p dir=\"ltr\">A knowledge-based American startup using Blockchain and related technologies has built a robust new advertising platform with potential to impact digital advertising and education.<\/p><p dir=\"ltr\"><a href=\"http://www.knowledge.io\" rel=\"nofollow,noopener\" target=\"_blank\">Knowledge.io<\/a>, based in Rocky River, Ohio, rewards people with cryptocurrency tokens for demonstrating knowledge and expertise in myriad topics ranging from Mercedes-Maybach S-Class sedans to Hollywood and Bollywood trivia. It then allows advertisers and marketers to harness this knowledge for varied use, often employing gamification techniques.<\/p><h2 dir=\"ltr\">Rating and rewarding knowledge<\/h2><p dir=\"ltr\">The knowledge-sharing startup is similar to Quora or Reddit, but what distinguishes it from its entrenched rivals is the ability to measure and rate people in varied knowledge areas, and a direct way of rewarding them with KNW tokens.<\/p><p dir=\"ltr\">At the heart of its business model is an advertising platform that helps monetize knowledge. Building on the advertising industry&#x2019;s traditional &#x201C;lookalike analysis,&#x201D; Knowledge.io has added a new functionality it calls &#x2018;Knowledge Match&#x2019;. The company states that Knowledge Match provides advanced personalization to match users with products or services, making advertising more effective.<\/p><h2 dir=\"ltr\">Scores and Q&amp;Ads enable targeted advertising<\/h2><p dir=\"ltr\">Most ad tech platforms build personas based on consumption of content. The Knowledge system adds a new dimension by scoring the knowledge level of people about topics, and then targeting ads suitably. These knowledge scores assigned to individuals allow advertisers to engage with people in a more effective way by customizing their messaging based on knowing where the user is within the &#x201C;knowledge funnel.&#x201D;<\/p><p dir=\"ltr\"><a href=\"https://knowledge.io/wp-content/uploads/2017/11/Knowledge.io-Whitepaper-19112017.pdf\" rel=\"nofollow,noopener\" target=\"_blank\">Knowledge.io<\/a>&#x2019;s advertising platform also has several recommender systems. Notably, these include the Q&amp;Ads platform, which is similar to Google&#x2019;s Adwords, Advertiser/Seller marketplace and Knowledge Graph, a recommendation engine based on matches. The Q&amp;Ads platform allows advertisers to select and identify keywords for target audiences based on topics and knowledge levels.<\/p><p dir=\"ltr\">Another key element of Knowledge.io&#x2019;s advertising platform is fraud protection. Using machine learning, among other technologies, it can, amongst other things, identify ad bots and stop fake impressions, saving millions of dollars for advertisers.<\/p><p dir=\"ltr\">&quot;The underlying <a href=\"https://cointelegraph.com/news/ibm-reveals-blockchain-computer-smaller-than-grain-of-salt-to-track-objects-devices\" target=\"_blank\">Blockchain<\/a> &#x2026; takes into account a set of increasingly complex algorithms that are used to combat fraud by bots and farms,&#x201D; Marcia Hales, co-founder of Knowledge.io, told <a href=\"https://www.forbes.com/sites/steveolenski/2017/12/19/digital-advertising-is-ripe-for-blockchain-disruption/#6b12322b327e\" rel=\"nofollow,noopener\" target=\"_blank\">Forbes<\/a>. &#x201C;These transactions are not rewarded for their fraudulent meta-mining activity. The ads.txt standard from the Interactive Advertising Bureau (IAB) are used as a way of whitelisting accredited publishers as part of this algorithm.&#x201D;<\/p><h2 dir=\"ltr\">Knowledge and education go hand in hand<\/h2><p dir=\"ltr\">The startup&#x2019;s parent company, International Knowledge League (IKL) has established <a href=\"https://knowledge.io/#partners\" rel=\"nofollow,noopener\" target=\"_blank\">partnerships<\/a> with Kelley Blue Book, the authoritative valuer for used cars in the United States; TiVo, a digital video service that enables recording and playback of television programmes; and Oxford University Press, a leading global publisher.<\/p><p dir=\"ltr\">IKL &#x2013; the maker of the Trivia Star app &#x2013; also has a partnership with the maker of the gaming app GamingGrids, bringing in an estimated 5 mln monthly active users (MAU). It is targeting an additional 250 mln MAU from a partnership with Trivia Spar.<\/p><h2 dir=\"ltr\">ICO targets $19 mln<\/h2><p dir=\"ltr\">Knowledge.io has developed a partnership with <a href=\"https://coinomi.com/\" rel=\"nofollow,noopener\" target=\"_blank\">Coinomi<\/a>, a London-based provider of cryptocurrency wallets, and has its CEO <a href=\"https://www.linkedin.com/in/kimionis/\" rel=\"nofollow,noopener\" target=\"_blank\">George Kimionis<\/a> to its advisory board.<\/p><p dir=\"ltr\">Out of 150 mln KNW Tokens created, Knowledge.io is offering up to 19 mln at $1 apiece in its ongoing <a href=\"https://tokens.knowledge.io/\" rel=\"nofollow,noopener\" target=\"_blank\">ICO<\/a>. After a pre-sale round in January, the main offering has been open since Feb. 12. The ICO closes on April 8, with over 5 mln tokens already sold.<\/p><div id=\"post-content\"><p><span style=\"font-size: 12px; color: rgb(169, 169, 169);\"><span style=\"font-weight:600\">Disclaimer.<\/span> Cointelegraph does not endorse any content or product on this page.

By the order, US citizens are banned from engaging in transactions using the oil-indexed digital currency.<\/p><p dir=\"ltr\">The ban frustrates the efforts of Maduro&#x2019;s government to boost foreign currency reserves. The token offering accepted transactions in US dollars and euros, meaning that Venezuelan citizens could not legally participate, as there is a ban in Venezuela on buying foreign currency.<\/p><p dir=\"ltr\">The order also authorizes US Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin to issue regulations to enforce the executive order. The Treasury Department <a href=\"https://home.treasury.gov/news/press-releases/sm0247\" rel=\"nofollow,noopener\" target=\"_blank\">announced sanctions<\/a> on four Venezuelan government officials earlier this year.<\/p><p dir=\"ltr\">According to Mnuchin, &#x201C;President Maduro decimated the Venezuelan economy and spurred a humanitarian crisis. Instead of correcting course&#x2026; the Maduro regime is attempting to circumvent sanctions through the Petro digital currency.&#x201D;<\/p><p dir=\"ltr\">The Treasury Department further warned investors in January to avoid the Petro, calling it &#x201C;another attempt to prop up the Maduro regime, while further looting the resources of the Venezuelan people.&#x201D;<\/p><p dir=\"ltr\">The Petro has struggled in finding legitimacy and interest among foreign governments. Earlier this year, the Venezuelan government claimed that <a href=\"https://cointelegraph.com/news/venezuelas-cryptocurrency-petro-finds-foreign-investors-ico-to-take-place-in-march\" target=\"_blank\">Poland was interested<\/a> in trading food and medicine for the Petro, which <a href=\"https://cointelegraph.com/news/polish-ministries-of-foreign-affairs-and-finance-refute-interest-in-venezuelas-petro\" target=\"_blank\">was later denied<\/a> by the Polish Ministry of Finance and Ministry of Foreign Affairs.&#xA0;&#xA0;<\/p><p dir=\"ltr\">Cambodia however, seems to have taken inspiration from Venezuela, and is considering its own state-sponsored digital currency, Entepay, Cointelegraph <a href=\"https://cointelegraph.com/news/inspired-by-venezuelan-petro-cambodia-may-issue-a-national-cryptocurrency\" target=\"_blank\">reported earlier<\/a> this month.<\/p> <div id=\"quiz\"> <\/div>",

  "body": "<p dir=\"ltr\">A peer-to-peer online learning platform is gearing up to bring the &#x201C;out of date&#x201D; education sector into the 21st century by becoming a one-stop shop for tutors and students.<\/p><p dir=\"ltr\">Blockchain-based <a href=\"https://ntok.io/\" rel=\"nofollow,noopener\" target=\"_blank\">NTOK<\/a> says its ecosystem helps to fundraise education and removes geographical hurdles for teachers and pupils &#x2013; and will offer a high-quality learning environment furnished with textbooks and courses from prominent publishers.<\/p><p dir=\"ltr\">The concept is already being put to the test, with an Alpha version of the platform being used as an online English language school. NTOK executives say they are obtaining &#x201C;rapid feedback&#x201D; from users so extra features can be developed.<\/p><p dir=\"ltr\">Although the company is planning to specialize in foreign languages, other offerings will include pre-school education, supplementary learning for primary and secondary school students and <a href=\"https://cointelegraph.com/news/rmit-university-launches-australias-first-blockchain-course\" target=\"_blank\">courses in coding and Blockchain<\/a>.<\/p><h2 dir=\"ltr\">A growing market with growing pains<\/h2><p dir=\"ltr\"><a href=\"https://www.researchandmarkets.com/research/6g3j6v/global_private\" rel=\"nofollow,noopener\" target=\"_blank\">According to a report by Research and Markets<\/a>, the global private tutoring market is forecast to grow at a compound annual rate of 6.7 percent between 2016 and 2020.<\/p><p dir=\"ltr\">In theory, this means greater choice for students and greater demand for tutors &#x2013; but NTOK argues that inadequate infrastructure and a continued emphasis on offline learning is stymying potential.<\/p><p dir=\"ltr\">The company claims some students are spending hours a day travelling to private lessons on top of their school commitments. Meanwhile, the lack of a dependable online system means there is an imbalance in supply and demand, with qualified tutors in rural areas unable to offer their services to families in bigger cities.<\/p><p dir=\"ltr\">Until now, affordability has also affected access to tutoring. Hourly rates are often inflated by middlemen who connect students with teachers, rendering extra support off limits to people from low-income households and making it harder for tutors to pay their bills.<\/p><p dir=\"ltr\">NTOK believes its ecosystem will take commercial study centers out of the equation and estimates this could bring lesson costs down by 75 percent, <a href=\"https://ntok.io/docs/en/NTOK%20White%20Paper.pdf\" rel=\"nofollow,noopener\" target=\"_blank\">with its white paper adding<\/a>: &#x201C;In NTOK, every student can find a tutor and every tutor can find a student.&#x201D;<\/p><p dir=\"ltr\">Although hourly rates would be brought down through the ecosystem, NTOK says tutors will have several revenue streams at their fingertips. The platform will allow specialists to sell pre-recorded lessons, and it hopes educational publishers will pay tutors to experiment with new teaching resources.<\/p><h2 dir=\"ltr\">Tokens, testimonials and technology<\/h2><p dir=\"ltr\">New Tokens Of Knowledge (NTOK), on the Ethereum Blockchain, will be used for payment on the platform and tutors with larger balances are going to be rewarded with higher search rankings.<\/p><p dir=\"ltr\"><a href=\"https://ntok.io/\" rel=\"nofollow,noopener\" target=\"_blank\">NTOK<\/a> claims the feedback systems of many direct and indirect competitors are often moderated, with negative reviews removed. Like other Blockchain start-ups, the company hopes its system will <a href=\"https://cointelegraph.com/news/customer-confidence-is-suffering-due-to-fake-reviews\" target=\"_blank\">stop feedback from being manipulated<\/a> &#x2013; allowing students to make informed decisions. To protect tutors, their overall rating will be based on an average for the past 30 days, preventing one bad score from disproportionately dragging down their reputation.<\/p><p dir=\"ltr\">The development of study areas has been a big focus for the company, with users being offered interactive whiteboards, file sharing, and connections for audio and video calls which deliver &#x201C;better quality than Skype&#x201D; &#x2013; the software commonly used for tutoring at present.<\/p><p dir=\"ltr\">NTOK&#x2019;s platform will champion the idea of &#x201C;tokenizing talents,&#x201D; where students can buy tutor hours in bulk at a fixed price &#x2013; preventing services from getting more expensive in the future. The company says this also allows tutors to &#x201C;pre-finance their personal development.&#x201D; It believes this concept will help evolve the current business and existing operations into a &#x201C;three-level Blockchain infrastructure for continuing, lifewide education.&#x201D;<\/p><h2 dir=\"ltr\">The tick-tock on NTOK<\/h2><p dir=\"ltr\">Future developments could include the sale of equipment to aid learning, including tablets and earphones for simultaneous interpretation.<\/p><p dir=\"ltr\">This effort to overcome linguistic hurdles ties in nicely with NTOK&#x2019;s plan for growth. China, South Korea and Japan are priority markets for its first three years of operation. Spanish-speaking countries will follow, as well as the US and UK.<\/p><p dir=\"ltr\">Backed by a team of seasoned tutors, software engineers and entrepreneurs, NTOK&#x2019;s ICO ends on April 15. Proceeds are capped at $15 mln, and 70 percent of tokens are being made available to the public.<\/p><p dir=\"ltr\">The company says cryptocurrency and fiat financing has been secured to develop the beta version of NTOK, and those who have a substantial amount of tokens will have the opportunity to vote on new features for the ecosystem in future.<\/p><div class=\"row\">&#xA0;<\/div><div id=\"post-content\"><p><span style=\"font-size: 12px; color: rgb(169, 169, 169);\"><span style=\"font-weight:600\">Disclaimer.<\/span> Cointelegraph does not endorse any content or product on this page.

Lee told the Financial Times:<\/p><blockquote><p dir=\"ltr\">&#x201C;Unfortunately this space changes so much that the vendors we chose&#x2026; eventually evolved such that they&#x2019;re not really useful to us, and we&#x2019;re not interested in doing it ourselves.&#x201D;<\/p><\/blockquote><p>The Canadian Securities Exchange, an alternative stock exchange that began operating in 2004, also <a href=\"https://cointelegraph.com/news/canadian-stock-exchange-launches-fully-regulated-token-funding-platform-unlike-icos\" target=\"_blank\">announced in February<\/a> that they will be launching an <a href=\"https://cointelegraph.com/tags/ethereum\" target=\"_blank\">Ethereum<\/a>-based securities and clearing platform, allowing companies to raise capital with security tokens.<\/p> <div id=\"quiz\"> <\/div>",
