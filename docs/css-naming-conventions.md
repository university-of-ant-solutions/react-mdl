### CSS NAMING CONVENTIONS

MDL was written using [BEM](https://en.bem.info/method/). BEM stands for Block, Element, Modifier. It is a method used to construct CSS class-names so they are consistent, isolated, and expressive. A few good resources for learning more about BEM methods are:

- [CSSWizardry](http://csswizardry.com/2013/01/mindbemding-getting-your-head-round-bem-syntax/)

- [CSS-Tricks](https://css-tricks.com/bem-101/)

- [Smashing Magazine](http://www.smashingmagazine.com/2012/04/16/a-new-front-end-methodology-bem/)

These are great resources that simplify the data needed to understand BEM. If you want to read the methodology from the inventors, [Yandex provides the resource](https://en.bem.info/). This reference goes way beyond just the CSS and into the full JavaScript setup they use as well.

Our [wiki](https://github.com/google/material-design-lite/wiki/Understanding-BEM) includes a section on the namespacing used for MDL specifically.
