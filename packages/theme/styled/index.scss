/**
MDC Theme is a foundational module that themes MDC Web components. The colors in this module are derived from three theme colors:

Primary: the primary color used in your application, applies to a number of UI elements.
Secondary: the secondary color used in your application, applies to a number of UI elements. (Previously called “accent”.)
Background: the background color for your application, aka the color on top of which your UI is drawn.
and five text styles:

Primary: used for most text
Secondary: used for text which is lower in the visual hierarchy
Hint: used for text hints, such as those in text fields and labels
Disabled: used for text in disabled components and content
Icon: used for icons
